Coursework and other projects related to Data Science.

The "Transfer.ipynb" file was an image recognition group project. The images were from a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gpiosenka/100-bird-species/versions/45), which had 300 bird species at the time (over 46000 images). My task in the group project was to use transfer learning to predict the images of birds. the RESNET architecture was selected, the final layer changed, and a test accuracy of 94% was obtained. Training, however, was very time-consuming, since the training took place on the CPU instead of GPU.
